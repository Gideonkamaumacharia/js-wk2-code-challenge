## Description
It's a code challenge with three different challenges. There are three different files containing the code solution for each individual challenge. All the files are well commented so that one can easily folow along.

The first challenge required one to Write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character.

The second challenge required one to write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them.

The last one required one to write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array.
